## Simplest Elm

This project consists of the most basic `Main` file, a single separate module, and a test that exercises the only function exposed by this module.

If this sounds like fun, and you have elm & yarn installed, try running this in the root of the project directory:
`yarn install && npx elm-test`

You should see a single test succeed. Now you're off to the races!
